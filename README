B-tree library for eventual proposal to Boost

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL LIBRARY STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION WORK.

To experiment with the library, various other boost libraries must be
available. Here is one way to create such a setup:

  git clone git@github.com:Beman/Boost-Btree.git btree
  cd ../boost
  mklink /d btree ..\libs\btree\include\boost\btree
  
As a confidence test, the following should build b2, build various
libraries and then run the regression tests.

Windows (assumes bootstrap has been run):

  cd boost-root/libs/btree/test
  ..\..\..\b2

POSIX-like systems (assumes bootstrap has been run):

  cd boost-root/libs/btree/test
  ../../../b2

A Windows Visual Studio solution is included:  btree\test\msvc2012\btree.sln
Be sure to do the following setup before starting Visual Studio.

Setup Windows to use the solution:
  
  set BOOST_TRUNK=boost-root-path
  path %path%;%BOOST_TRUNK%\stage\lib  
  cd %BOOST_TRUNK%
  .\bootstrap
  .\b2 --with-system --with-chrono --with-timer --with-filesystem link=shared stage

To find out more about builds:

  cd boost-root
  .\b2 --help
