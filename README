B-tree library for eventual proposal to Boost

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL LIBRARY STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.
IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION WORK.

To experiment with the library, various other boost libraries must be
available. Here is one way to create such a setup:

  cd boost-root/libs
  git clone git@github.com:Beman/Boost-Btree.git btree
  cd ../boost
  mklink /d btree ..\libs\btree\include\boost\btree
  
As a confidence test, the following should build bjam, build various
libraries and then run the regression tests.

Windows (assumes bootstrap has been run):

  cd boost-root/libs/btree/test
  ..\..\..\bjam

POSIX-like systems (assumes bootstrap has been run):

  cd boost-root/libs/btree/test
  ../../../bjam

A Visual Studio solution is included at boost-root\libs\btree\test\msvc10.
Setup:
   
  cd boost-root
  .\bootstrap
  .\b2 --with-system --with-chrono --with-timer --with-filesystem link=static stage

Static linking eases VC++ debugging since these library's dll's don't have to be found.

To find out more about builds:

  cd boost-root
  .\b2 --help
