<title>Btree Two Layer Design</title>

<h1>Boost Btree Two Layer Design</h1>
<p><b>Problem:</b> Every attempt at implementing C++ variable length btree (VLBTR) 
has been either an outright failure or has sub-optimal performance.&nbsp; 
Abstracting away the difference between fixed-length and variable-length makes 
the code difficult to understand and difficult to reason about.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Solution:</b> Btrees are fixed-length, period. Anything else should be 
  layered on top of the unmodified fixed-length btree (FLBTR) implementation so 
  that FLBTRs do what they do best, and don&#39;t become degraded by trying to do 
  things they aren&#39;t suited for. The effect of a VLBTR is achieved by adding a 
  level of indirection; a FLBTR acts as an index (i.e. a set of file offsets) 
  into a separate flat file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Problem:</b> Btrees tend to become sub-optimal when the length of the 
value type is large in relation to the optimal node size. The optimal node size 
is closely related to the operating system&#39;s disk page size, and is not 
something the btree library can alter.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Solution:</b> Add a layer of indirection; a FLBTR acts as an index (i.e. 
  a set of file offsets) into a separate flat file. This has been the approach 
  to the problem since the earliest days of Btrees and was described by Bayer 
  himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Additional thoughts</h3>
<p><b>1)</b> There is so little difference between the two proposed solutions 
that it may be possible for a single implementation to solve both problems.</p>
<p><b>2)</b> A memory-mapped file might be the ideal implementation technique 
for the flat file.</p>
<p><b>3)</b> A experimental prototype can be built on top of the current 
implementation, without any changes to it. Removal of the current VLBTR code 
isn&#39;t necessary to prove the concept.</p>
<p><b>4)</b> If the offset (i.e. an id.) into the flat file is exposed, users 
could access flat file elements directly. Such a feature was previously 
implemented and found useful in another context.</p>
<p><b>5)</b> Multiple indexes into a single flat file would be a possible future 
extention.</p>
