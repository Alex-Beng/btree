tree-walk is a branch of vflip.

The leaf page sequence list will be eliminated. Iteration will be done by tree walk.

The tree walk approach has been under consideration from the very start. It is being explored now because non-unique erase(iterator), and to a lesser extent other non-unique modifying operations, need live parent pointers. That implies either adding branch sequence lists or tree walking. Tree walking may be simpler, and saves precious disk page real estate.
