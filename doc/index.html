  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The proposed Boost B-tree library provides associative
  containers that are resident on some form of random access external memory, 
  such as a hard-disk, solid-state disk, or USB memory-stick.. B-trees perform well on hardware ranging
  from ancient floppy disk drives up to humongous hard-drive arrays. B-trees are the technology behind 
  many or even most high-performance disk file-systems and 
  disk-resident databases.</p>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" style=
  "border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">

        <p align="center"><b><font size="3">The B in "B-tree" does
        not stand for "Binary"</font></b></p>

        <p>The origin of "B-tree" has never been explained by the
        authors [<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Bayer" title=

        we shall see, "balanced," "broad," or "bushy" might apply.
        Others suggest that the "B" stands for Boeing [their employer]. Because of
        his contributions, however, it seems appropriate to think
        of B-trees as "Bayer"-trees.</p>

  <h2>Library Characteristics</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The interface and behavior is similar, but not identical, to the C++
    Standard Library's <code>map</code>, <code>multimap</code>, <code>set</code>, 
    and <code>multiset</code>. Differences include:<br>
&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Types supplied by the <code>Key</code> and
        <code>T</code> template parameters must be copyable via
      <code>std::memcpy</code> and must not contain pointers or references.</li>
      <li>Interfaces traffic in <code>const_iterator</code>. Maps provide a
      <code>writable()</code> function that turns a const_iterator into an 
      iterator.</li>
      <li><code>insert()</code>,&nbsp; <code>emplace()</code>, and <code>erase()</code>
        invalidate iterators.</li>
      <li>No <code>operator[]</code> or <code>at</code> functions supplied. 
      Returning references to data that can be swapped out even by const 
      functions is too dangerous.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Additional classes provide <a href="faq.html#index-idea">indexes</a> 
    into a flat file.<br>
&nbsp;<ul>
    <li>Variable length data can be accommodated. Strings are supported via the 
    new standard library TS <code>string_view</code> class which provides the 
    familiar <code>std::string</code> interface. A version of the TS <code>
    string_view</code> class is provided, so things like <code>
    my_map.emplace(&quot;FWIW&quot;, &quot;For what its worth&quot;);</code> work out of the box.</li>
    <li>Very large data elements are not a problem. Because B-trees are most 
    efficient when value types are very small relative to the hardware's natural 
    page size (4096 for most current hard disks), a pure B-tree slows 
    dramatically if given value types even a few hundred bytes in length, let 
    alone much larger sizes. Using a B-tree as an index into a flat file that 
    actually contains the data has long been the preferred solution.</li>
    <li>A single flat file can be indexed by as many indexes as desired. Thus a 
    customer record can be indexed by account-number, name, and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

    </li>
    <li>Runtime options allow performance tuning:<br>
&nbsp;<ul>
    <li>Page size allows hardware specific tuning at file creation time.</li>
    <li>Cache size allows control over speed versus program memory tradeoff.</li>
    <li>Preload option allows control over speed versus operating system disk cache 
    memory tradeoff.</li>
    <li>Hints ease task of performance tuning.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

    </li>
    <li>Traits allow users to specify internal types:<br>
&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Endian types are used by default to ensure portable files. Prepackaged big, little, 
      and native endian traits are supplied.</li>
      <li>User defined traits can be supplied to support specific needs.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The specific B-tree form used is the B<sup>+</sup> tree. Modifications to the classic B<sup>+</sup> tree
    include: <br>
&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>New-node-on-full (i.e. lazy) rather than split-on-full for ordered inserts. 
      Benefits include ability to pack a B-Tree for 100% disk and memory space 
      utilization and, as a result, faster operation. </li>
      <li>Free-at-empty (i.e. lazy) rather than rebalancing
        erases. See the Sen/Tarjan
      <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sssix/papers/b-trees.pdf">paper</a> 
      for discussion of rationale.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The disk file includes meta information about the
      tree, including user supplied information.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Currently implemented in C++03. Tests pass in recent versions of GCC on 
    Linux, OS X, and Windows, VC++ on Windows, and Clang on OS X. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Coming Soon</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A bulk load option that generates packed trees. Fastest way to load 
    large datasets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Wish List</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Utility functionality such as <code>btpack</code>,
    <code>btinfo</code>, and <code>btrecover</code> to meet
    administrative needs.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Concurrent use by other processes is a 
    high priority for the future.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Multiple B-trees in one file. Requested by Cory Nelson. Possible design: 
    Initial btree_map in the file is an index of its children. Key: name, Data: 
    page id of the child's header page. Recursion allowed; the header page 
    pointed could itself be an index header. Current interface might gain 
    additional constructor and open() overload taking a ref to the parent index 
    and the desired name.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Memory mapped file based B-tree. Requested by Cory Nelson &quot;for small 
    B-trees or large address spaces&quot;. The flat files indexed by the index 
    classes already use memory mapped files.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>C++11 features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>History of the library</h2>

  <p>A PL/1 language B-tree library was developed by the author about 1982. It 
  was redone in C in 1984, and has been in continuous use in industrial 
  applications since then. It was based on a single cursor model rather than an 
  iterator model. Although the Boost library is a new design and is implemented 
  with all new code, the predecessor library provided the experience that taught 
  me about B-trees in general, and the specifics of what is needed and what 
  isn't.</p>

  <h2>Designs paths not taken</h2>

  <p>Based on prior experience including actual implementation and use, several 
  features described in the literature are not included:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Key prefix compression.</b> All the keys on a page may have the same 
    value for their initial bytes. Particularly on branches, this prefix could 
    be stored only once, saving space and allowing more entries per page, and in 
    turn that could speed searches. The added complexity is considerable, and 
    the increased computational burden tends to result in slower rather than 
    faster operations. Might be worth considering in the future for variable 
    length keys only; they already have to provide some of the needed machinery. 
    The C predecessor library abandoned this approach early on because it didn't 
    actually speed up applications in practice.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Key computation on branch pages.</b> The keys stored on branch pages need 
    not be full length, as long as the ordering is maintained. Thus for a branch 
    key separating pointers to pages with last key &quot;ALPHA&quot; and first key &quot;BETA&quot;, 
    respectively, it is sufficient to store &quot;B&quot; as the branch key rather than 
    &quot;BETA&quot;. Although the C predecessor library still uses computed branch keys 
    if keys are variable length, it has been a source of hard to track down 
    bugs, and doesn't support deletion properly to this day.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Bidirectional page sequence list.</b> Adds page space overhead and 
    insert/erase program complexity. Doing an inverted tree walk to the prior or next 
    page during traversal is simple and effective.</li>
  </ul>
