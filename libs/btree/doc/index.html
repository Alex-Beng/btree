  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Boost B-tree library provides disk-based associative
  containers that scale all the way from really, really, small to
  really, really, large. B-trees perform well on hardware ranging
  from ancient floppy disk drives up to humongous disk arrays. B-trees are the technology behind most high-performance disk file
  systems and databases.</p>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" style=
  "border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">
        <p align="center"><b><font size="3">The B in "B-tree" does
        not stand for "Binary"</font></b></p>

        <p>The origin of "B-tree" has never been explained by the
        authors [<a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Bayer" title=
        "Rudolf Bayer">Rudolf Bayer</a> and Edward McCreight]. As
        we shall see, "balanced," "broad," or "bushy" might apply.
        Others suggest that the "B" stands for Boeing. Because of
        his contributions, however, it seems appropriate to think
        of B-trees as "Bayer"-trees.</p>

  <h2>Library Characteristics</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Public interface similar but not identical to the C++
    Standard Library's <code>map</code>, <code>multimap</code>, <code>set</code>, 
    and <code>multiset</code>. Differences include:<br>
&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>All iterator returning functions return
        <code>const_iterator</code>. The <code>writeable()</code>
        function turns <code>const_iterator</code> into
        <code>iterator</code>.</li>
      <li><code>insert()</code> and <code>erase()</code>
        invalidate iterators.</li>
      <li>Types supplied by the <code>Key</code> and
        <code>T</code> template parameters must be trivially copyable; i.e. via
      <code>std::memcpy</code>.</li>
      <li>No <code>operator[]</code> or <code>at</code> functions supplied. 
      Returning references to data that can be swapped out, even by const 
      functions, is far too dangerous.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>B<sup>+</sup>-tree disk structure with bidirectional page
    sequence list. Modifications to the classic B<sup>+</sup>-tree
    include: <br>
&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>New-page-on-full (i.e. lazy) rather than split-on-full for ordered inserts.</li>
      <li>Free-at-empty (i.e. lazy) rather than merge-at-half for
        erases.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Disk file format includes header information about the
      tree. The header format includes space for user supplied information.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Runtime options allow performance tuning:<br>
&nbsp;<ul>
    <li>Page size allows hardware specific tuning at file creation time.</li>
    <li>Cache size allows control over speed versus program memory tradeoff.</li>
    <li>Preload option allows control over speed versus operating system disk cache 
    memory tradeoff.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

    </li>
    <li>Traits allow user to specify implementation types:<br>
&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Default is to native types, for maximum efficiency.</li>
      <li>Endian types can be used to ensure data file portable. Prepackaged big 
      and little endian traits supplied.</li>
      <li>Larger or smaller types can be used for
          very large or very small trees. Prepackaged compact tree traits 
      supplied.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Command line utilities <code>btpack</code>,
    <code>btinfo</code>, and <code>btrecover</code> meet
    administrative needs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Wish List</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Efficient variable length data, such as strings. A simple string type that always uses its maximum length is 
    provided as a workaround. Efficient variable length data is a very high priority 
    for the future.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Concurrent use by other processes is a 
    high priority for the future.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Multiple B-trees in one file. Requested by Cory Nelson. Possible design: 
    Initial btree_map in the file is an index of its children. Key: name, Data: 
    page id of the child's header page. Recursion allowed; the header page 
    pointed could itself be an index header. Current interface might gain 
    additional constructor and open() overload taking a ref to the parent index 
    and the desired name.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Memory mapped I/O. Requested by Cory Nelson &quot;for small B-trees or large 
    address spaces&quot;. Beman comments that the interface might differ, since 
    functions specified by the standard to return <code>iterator</code> could do 
    so, rather than returning <code>const_iterator</code>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Add C++0x signatures.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>History</h2>

  <p>A PL/1 language B-tree library was developed by the author about 1982. It 
  was redone in C in 1984, and has been in continuous use in industrial 
  applications since then. It was based on a single cursor model rather than an 
  iterator model. Although the Boost library is a new design and is implemented 
  with all new code, the predecessor library provided the experience that taught 
  me about B-trees in general, and the specifics of what is needed and what 
  isn't.</p>

  <h2>Designs paths not taken</h2>

  <p>Based on prior experience including actual implementation and use, several 
  features described in the literature are not included:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Key prefix compression.</b> All the keys on a page may have the same 
    value for their initial bytes. Particularly on branches, this prefix could 
    be stored only once, saving space and allowing more entries per page, and in 
    turn that could speed searches. The added complexity is considerable, and 
    the increased computational burden tends to result in slower rather than 
    faster operations. Might be worth considering in the future for variable 
    length keys only; they already have to provide some of the needed machinery. 
    The C predecessor library abandoned this approach early on because it didn't 
    actually speed up applications in practice.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Key computation on branch pages.</b> The keys stored on branch pages need 
    not be full length, as long as the ordering is maintained. Thus for a branch 
    key separating pointers to pages with last key &quot;ALPHA&quot; and first key &quot;BETA&quot;, 
    respectively, it is sufficient to store &quot;B&quot; as the branch key rather than 
    &quot;BETA&quot;. Although the C predecessor library still uses computed branch keys 
    if keys are variable length, it has been a source of hard to track down 
    bugs, and doesn't support deletion properly to this day in that library.</li>
  </ul>
