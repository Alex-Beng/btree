vflip is a branch of branch "vbase2".

The key insight is that by exchanging the order of branch_value_type data members, P0 can be eliminated. This may eliminate some complex and error prone special case code.

It would work this way:

* branch_value_type members would be ordered page_id_type, key_type.

* The end iterator would be dereferenceable to obtain the page_id. In other words, the extra page_id_type value is at the end, rather than the beginning of the sequence.

* Code should be simpler since it is never necessary to decrement begin(), which may have made sense in C or assembler, but is really tricky in C++.
